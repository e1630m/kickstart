# Google [kick start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) Solutions
## Table of Contents
Google started to release test data for the kick start challenge of 2021, and I included benchmark data of my solutions to 2021 problems using the released data. But any solution to pre-2021 problems do not have benchmark data, since Google hasn't released test data for the kick start challenges prior to 2021.
