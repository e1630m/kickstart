# Google [kick start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) Solutions
## Table of Contents
Google started to release the test data of the kick start challenge problems on 2021. Using the release data, I did some benchmarks on my solutions to 2021 problems, and post the result on the following table. However, any solution to pre-2021 problems do not have benchmark data, since Google hasn't released test data of pre-2021 challenges.
